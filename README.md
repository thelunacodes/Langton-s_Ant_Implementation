# My implementation of the Langton's Ant using Python!

#### Context:

*"Langton's ant is a two-dimensional Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior. It was invented by Chris Langton in 1986 and runs on a square lattice of black and white cells."*

Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant)


#### How it works

The "ant's" movements follow these rules: 

- If the "ant" is on a **WHITE** cell, it will turn 90° clockwise, change the color of the cell to **BLACK** and move one (1) cell forward.
- But, if the "ant" is on a **BLACK** cell, it will turn 90° clockwise, change the color of the cell to **WHITE** and move one (1) cell forward.
